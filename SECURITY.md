# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest 1.x stable release is supported. Fixes for relevant bugs and
security issues are backported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security related issue, it is best to email us instead of
opening a public issue.
If your message is very sensitive, you may want to use PGP, but in most cases
it's not needed.
